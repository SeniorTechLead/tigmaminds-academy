        '**Start with what you can already see.** Stand 50 paces from the base of a tall tree and tilt your head up until you are looking right at the top. The angle your gaze makes with the ground is fixed by two things: how far away you stood, and how tall the tree is. If somebody told you the angle and the distance, could you figure out the height *without climbing*?\n\n' +

        '**Why ratios and not lengths?** A photo of a triangle and the real triangle look different in size — but the *ratios* of their sides are identical. Two right triangles with the same angle θ are similar; their sides scale together. So sin 30° is the same number for a triangle the size of your hand and one the size of a building. Trig captures the shape, not the size.\n\n' +
        '**Walked example — the 30° triangle.** A right triangle has hypotenuse 10 cm and one of its angles is 30°. Find the other two sides.\n\n' +

        '| 3 | Solve: opposite = 10 × 0.5 | **5 cm** |\n' +
        '| 4 | For the adjacent side use cos: cos 30° = adjacent / 10, and cos 30° ≈ 0.866. | — |\n' +
        '| 5 | adjacent = 10 × 0.866 | **≈ 8.66 cm** |\n' +
        '| 6 | Sanity check with Pythagoras: 5² + 8.66² should equal 10². | 25 + 75 = 100 ✓ |\n\n' +
        '**Check yourself — predict before you compute.** A right triangle has hypotenuse 12 m and θ = 45°. Without a calculator, are the other two sides going to be (a) both equal, (b) one bigger and one smaller, (c) impossible to say? *(Answer at the end of this section.)*\n\n' +

        '**Answer to the predict-yourself question:** Both sides equal. At 45°, opposite = adjacent because sin 45° = cos 45°. The triangle is isosceles. Each side ≈ 12 × 0.707 ≈ **8.49 m**.',

        '**Inverse functions: from a ratio back to an angle.** SOH CAH TOA gives you a side when you know the angle. Often you know two sides and need the angle. The inverse functions arcsin (sin⁻¹), arccos (cos⁻¹), arctan (tan⁻¹) reverse the process.\n\n' +

        '**Worked example — surveyor finds tower height.** A surveyor stands 40 m from the base of a cell tower and measures the angle of elevation as 53°. The tower is on level ground.\n\n' +
        '| Step | Reasoning | Calc |\n' +
        '|------|-----------|------|\n' +
        '| 1 | Known: adjacent = 40 m, want height = opposite. The ratio is tan: tan 53° = h / 40. | — |\n' +

        '| 3 | h = 40 × 1.327 | **≈ 53.1 m** |\n' +
        '| 4 | If the surveyor\'s eye was 1.6 m off the ground, tower\'s actual height = 53.1 + 1.6. | **≈ 54.7 m** |\n\n' +
        '**Predicting the answer first.** When θ is between 0° and 45°, tan θ < 1, so the opposite side is *shorter* than the adjacent side. When θ > 45°, tan θ > 1 and the opposite side is *longer*. Here θ = 53° (just above 45°), so we expect h to be slightly larger than 40 m. The answer 53.1 m is consistent — useful sanity check.\n\n' +
        '**Pythagoras + trig together.** If you know the hypotenuse and one ratio, you can recover the other ratio without a calculator:\n\n' +
        '`sin²θ + cos²θ = 1` ⟹ `cos θ = √(1 − sin²θ)` (when cos θ ≥ 0)\n\n' +
        'Example: if sin θ = 3/5, then cos²θ = 1 − 9/25 = 16/25, so cos θ = 4/5 and tan θ = sin/cos = 3/4. This is the famous 3-4-5 right triangle.',

        '**Hyperbolic counterparts.** Replace the imaginary unit with 1 in the exponentials and you get **hyperbolic** sin and cos:\n\n' +
        '`sinh x = (eˣ − e⁻ˣ) / 2`,  `cosh x = (eˣ + e⁻ˣ) / 2`\n\n' +

        '**The problem with SOH CAH TOA.** Look back at our right triangle. What is sin 120°? You can\'t form a right triangle with an angle bigger than 90° — the sides would have to bend backwards. SOH CAH TOA breaks down. We need a definition that works for *any* angle: 120°, 270°, 1000°, even negative angles.\n\n' +
        '**The fix — use a circle instead of a triangle.** Draw a circle of radius 1 centred at the origin. Pick any angle θ measured from the positive x-axis, going counter-clockwise. The point where your angle\'s ray crosses the circle has coordinates (x, y). We *define*:\n\n' +
        '`cos θ = x`,  `sin θ = y`\n\n' +

        '**Why this matches the triangle definition.** Drop a vertical line from the point on the circle to the x-axis. You get a right triangle with hypotenuse 1, opposite = y, adjacent = x. Then sin θ = opp/hyp = y/1 = y. Same for cos θ = x. The unit circle is just SOH CAH TOA in disguise — but it keeps working as θ wraps around.\n\n' +
